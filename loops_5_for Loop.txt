for loop , the most used loop in programming . This loop is almost similar to while loop but here we will be knowing how many iterations we need to perform before termination

Syntax:

    for(initialization; condition ; updation) {
        // statements to execute inside loop
    }

Example:
    
        for(int i=1; i<10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }

        In the above example , we are initializing a variable i with value 1 , then we are checking if i is less than 10 , if it is true then we are printing the value of i and then incrementing the value of i by 1 . This process will continue until the condition becomes false . In this case , the loop will run for 10 times and the output will be 1 to 9.

        We can also write the above example as below , notice that we are not initializing the variable i in the for loop , we are initializing it before the loop. We can also write the updation part inside the loop.This is just similar to while loop.
        
        int i=1; // initialization
        for(; i< 10; ){
            System.out.println(i);
            i++; // updation
        }
