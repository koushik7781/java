do while loop is used rarely in any program. It is used when we want to execute the loop at least once. The syntax of do while loop is given below:

Syntax: 
do
{
    //statements to be executed

    //increment/decrement;

} while(condition);

Example:

    int i = 1;
    do{
        System.out.println(i);
        i++;
    } while(i<=10);

Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

In the above example, the loop will be executed at least once because the condition is checked at the end of the loop.
