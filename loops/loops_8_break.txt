Break and continue statements are used to alter the flow of a normal loop. break is used to exit a loop, while continue is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration.

Break:

The break statement is used to exit a loop. The break statement is used inside loops. The break statement breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop (if any):

Example:
    take input from the user until he enters a specific type of number , say 0
    then we can use break statement to exit the loop

    * It's same break statement used in switch case statements , if any case is true then break statement is used to exit the switch case.

Continue:

The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. The continue statement is used inside loops. The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

Example:
    take input fromt the user repeatedly and print all except multiples of 10.

Note: Break statement is the most used statement in loops.Continue is not used that much, because the same thing can be done by using if-else statement.
