while loop, this will be useful mostly when we know the termination condition .

Example :- If i say drive the bike till fuel tank in not emptied , here I'm giving a termination condition that you should stop when fuel tank is empty so , here we will use while loop.

Syntax:

    //loop iterator initialization
    while(condition) {
        //statements to execute in while loop

        //loop iterator increment or decrement part
    }


# Note: It's mandatory that at a point the condition should fail else it will be an infinite loop , which keeps on running until the memory get's filled.

As a good programmer it's our duty to avoid these infinite loops in our program.
